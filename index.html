<h2>PRIVACY POLICY</h2>
<p> This policy is effective as of 11 July 2020

<br/> Hello :)

<br/>In case you don’t know, this is an application that allows you to keep abreast of whether your friends and relatives are close and easy in an unobtrusive way.

<br/>We understand that when you share your data, privacy is very important. Therefore, we have created several functions that let you know exactly what information you are sending, and control this process. We have compiled this Privacy Policy so that you are aware of how it all looks. This Policy applies to your use of the URFriends application.
</p>
<h2>Important information</h2>
<p>Before we begin, we would like to draw your attention to important information.

<br/>When you use our services, you share information with URFriends, only we are involved in data control and data processing.

<br/>To create your account, we only need access to the contact book, your geolocation and phone number. With the help of contact details URFriends will identify you, and with the help of a phone number your account will be confirmed.

<br/>URFriends is a geolocation service. Therefore, in order to provide services properly, we will need access to your location data. And we will keep them.
<br/>You can always write to us at info@urfriends.app if you have questions regarding the Privacy Policy or if you want to access your data, change it or delete it.

<br/>We use a data retention and deletion policy that determines how long we retain your information. By default, we store information for the duration of your use of the URFriends application.
</p>
<h2>Information We Collect</h2>
<p>There are two categories of information we collect:

<br/>provided by you;

<br/>Received by us when you use URFriends;
</p>

<h2>Information provided by you</h2>
<p>When you use our service, we collect information that you deem necessary to share with us.

<br/>Check in. When you register in the application, you provide us with your first name (which can be either a real name / surname or a pseudonym - it will be different, depending on how you are written in the contact book of other people), and a phone number. During registration, we will send you an SMS with a code that will allow us to confirm your account (this is much easier and safer than remembering a password). If you have not received a confirmation code, you can request a regular phone call.

<br/>Profile picture. All photos of your profile or the profile of other people, we take from the contact book.

<br/>Contacts. We also allow you to share your contact list so that you can easily find friends already registered with URFriends. It also means that it will be easier for you to invite friends to URFriends and make your stay more fun! It is worth noting that we only download the phone numbers of your contacts (and their names!), And all data is reliably protected. Simply put, your address book is secure and encrypted so that even we ourselves will not be able to read it.

<br/>The location. URFriends is a geolocation service. For the app to function properly, we need your exact location. We do not keep the history of your geolocation, only the last location. We get this data thanks to the access settings of your phone. Data comes to us using methods such as GPS, wireless networks, cellular towers, Wi-Fi access points and various devices such as gyroscopes, accelerometers and compasses. Information about your location is always marked with a time stamp, without which we will not be able to provide important functions for the service.
</p>

<h2>Legal framework for the use of your information</h2>
<p>Since we are located in Russia, we have the right to use your personal information only if certain conditions are met. These conditions are called legal bases, and we at URFriends typically rely on one of the following four:

<br/>The contract. The first reason why we may need to use your information is to ensure the operation of our services described in the Terms of Service. Since URFriends is a geolocation application, we will need to access and store geolocation data in order to provide you our services. Without this information, the application simply cannot work.

<br/>Legal right. Another reason we may need to use your information is the so-called “legal right”. For example, we need your data to provide and improve our services, protect your account, provide URFriends services, provide user support and help you find friends. It is important to understand that our legal rights do not outweigh your right to privacy. Therefore, we rely on legal right only when we believe that the use of your data will not have a significant impact on your privacy, if you consent or if there is a very good reason.

<br/>Consent. In some cases, we may ask for consent to use your information for certain purposes. In these cases, we will give you the right to withdraw your consent either in the services themselves or through the device’s access settings. Even if we do not need your consent to use the information, we can still request access to data such as contacts and location.

<br/>Legal obligations. In some cases, the use of your personal information may be required by law, for example in the case of legal proceedings or to take action to protect our users.
</p>

<h2> How do we share information</h2>
<p>We can share your information in the following ways:

<br/>With other users of URFriends. In particular, we can give them the following information:

<br/>Information about you, including name, nickname, list of friends, their number, profile photo.

<br/>Your location, but only if the user is your friend and you have allowed him access. We also want to draw attention to the fact that your friends can have access to your location regardless of where you are located. This means that if your friend travels abroad, then he or she can still see where you are and vice versa. Remember: at any time you can restrict access to information about your location in the application itself.

<br/>Any other information that you have agreed to share. For example, when you allow us to access the contacts of a device, we can share information about you with other users who have your name and phone number in the contacts of their device.

</p>
<h2>How long do we keep your information </h2>
<p>
We store your information for as long as necessary and while you are a user of our service. We have several storage protocols depending on the type of information. As a rule, we store information throughout the entire time that you use URFriends. Do you want us to delete your data? Do not worry, while you use the application, nothing will happen to them.
<br/>The following data will be stored while you use URFriends:

<br/>your name from the contact list of other people and phone number;
<br/>profile photo;
<br/>encrypted items from the contact book;
<br/>geolocation data;

</p>
<h2>Managing your information</h2>
<p>It is very important for us that you have full control over your information! Here are the ways we achieve this:

<br/>The location. You can select the visibility of your current location for friends in the application settings. We allow you to share this data only with some friends or with no one at all.

<br/>Access. We try to provide you with access and the ability to update most of your personal information that we hold. As a rule, you can do this in the "Profile" section of the application. If you need to access, update or delete any personal information that we may possess, write to us at info@urfriends.app. Just remember that we can ask you to verify your identity or provide additional information before we provide you with access to your information.

<br/>Right to refuse. You have the right to refuse to use your information to us, but then using our application will become useless.
</p>
<h2>Children</h2>
<p>Our services are not intended for persons under 13 years of age, and we do not provide them. Therefore, we cannot intentionally collect your information if you are under 13 years old. In addition, you must be at least the age at which you can consent to the processing of personal information in accordance with the laws of your country.
</p>
 <h2>Privacy Policy Updates</h2>
<p>From time to time, we may amend this Privacy Policy. When this happens, we will notify you in one way or another. Sometimes you can find out about this by seeing a new date at the top of the Privacy Policy (it is available on GooglePlay and in the application). In other cases (especially if the changes are significant), we will notify you additionally, for example, post a notification on the main pages of our services or show you it in the application itself.
   
<br/> That's all.
<br/>If you have additional questions, write to us at info@urfriends.app.
